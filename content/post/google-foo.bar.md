Once in the evening, I’ve been helped Google to save Bunny Planet.
 
My friend from India told me that forest pythons are extremely dangerous. And my bear fighting skills that I developed during childhood in Russia will barely help me if I will meet such a big snake as a python in wood. 
So, I was looking for some documentation about catching a python: tips from masters, evidence of survivals. In short, anything that can be useful for me to learn how to end my morning workout runs through jungles alive.
 
Suddenly Google search page start transforming in a console terminal. 
I was surprised and did not believe my eyes. The first thing I did was a screenshot:

You’re speaking our language. Up for a challenge?
 
The first thought came to my sharp mind was that I did not speak anything, I was silently googling for answers. But somehow Google figured out that I speak their language. Apparently, they bluffed. I’m not used to retreating, and I've decided to play. Did not expect, Google?
 
The blue button brings me to a browser based black console terminal.
Google told me that I'd been managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organisation and earned some entry level position. Not bad at all, according to that the only thing I did was looking for python catching docs. My goal was to stop LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet.
Suddenly, I needed to do that by writing code for algorithmic problems. 
Well, as my grandpa used to tell me: when you need to save the world, you need to save the world.
 
During my adventure, I’ve made some notes in a [journal] that I stored on GitHub.
 
In the end, I’ve destroyed LAMBCHOP doomsday device, saved lots of bunnies and their planet, and solved lots of interesting problems.  
Thank you for such a great experience, Google!
I’m waiting for new missions, but for now, it is finally a time to learn how to survive in jungles.
